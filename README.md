# project title                    FIDO FACTS
 
 # Description
Fido Facts is an online website/app that provides information and facts about dogs to anyone who may be interested. 
  
Creating Fido Facts was motivation to our team because we learned new techniques along the way. Also we built Fido Facts to help other people find 

what they are looking for within a dog breed. The positive effect that Fido Facts solve is allowing people to receive actual facts and 

descriptions on almost any dog breed. Throughout this creation I have learned more stratagies on making a website/app.
